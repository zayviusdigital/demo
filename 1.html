WebView can also assist with common browsing metaphors, such as history list of visited URLs to support backwards and forwards navigation.

Still WebView comes with its own set of cons such as it’s a much more expensive widget to use, in terms of memory consumption than a TextView. The reason for this increased memory is because WebView is powered by WebKit/Blink that are open source Web rendering engine to power content in browsers like Chrome.

Android WebView Example
Android WebView component is inserted into the XML layout file for the layout we want the WebView to be displayed in. In this example we insert it into the activity_main.xml file as shown below:


<RelativeLayout xmlns:android="https://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:tools="https://schemas.android.com/tools" android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent" android:paddingLeft="@dimen/activity_horizontal_margin"
    android:paddingRight="@dimen/activity_horizontal_margin"
    android:paddingTop="@dimen/activity_vertical_margin"
    android:paddingBottom="@dimen/activity_vertical_margin" tools:context=".MainActivity">

    <WebView
        android:id="@+id/webview"
        android:layout_alignParentTop="true"
        android:layout_alignParentLeft="true"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"/>
</RelativeLayout>
Android Studio WebView Code
WebView component is initialized in the MainActivity using its id defined in the activity_main.xml as shown in snippet below:


WebView webView = (WebView) findViewById(R.id.webview);
Android WebView loadUrl
Once we’ve obtained a reference to the WebView we can configure it and load URLs via HTTP. WebView loadUrl() method is
